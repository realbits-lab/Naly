# Cursor Rules for Naly Project

## Commit Message Guidelines

When writing commit messages for GitHub:

1. **Before Writing**: 
   - Always examine what changes were made using `git diff` or `git status`
   - Review the actual file changes to understand what was modified
   - Use `git add` to stage specific changes if needed

2. **Title (First Line)**: 
   - Use 10-15 words maximum
   - Be specific and descriptive
   - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
   - No period at the end

3. **Body**:
   - List the specific items that were changed
   - Use bullet points for clarity
   - Be concise but descriptive
   - Focus on what was done, not why (unless the why is not obvious)
   - Do NOT include conclusions, closing remarks, or closing statements

### Examples:

**Good:**
```
Add user authentication with Google OAuth integration

- Implement Google OAuth provider configuration
- Add user session management
- Create protected route middleware
- Update user schema with OAuth fields
```

**Good:**
```
Fix article generation timeout issues

- Increase timeout from 30s to 60s
- Add retry logic for failed requests
- Improve error handling for API calls
- Update loading states in UI
```

**Avoid:**
```
Fixed some bugs and added features
```

## Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Maintain consistent formatting with Prettier
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks

## Project Structure

- Keep components in `/src/components/`
- API routes in `/src/app/api/`
- Database schemas in `/src/lib/schema/`
- Types in `/src/types/`
- Utilities in `/src/lib/`

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test patterns in `/__tests__/` and `/tests/`
